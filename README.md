## Objective:

To provide actionable insights into the global data professional landscape by analyzing demographics, career paths, job satisfaction, and aspirations, helping organizations and individuals understand workforce trends, career transitions, and key factors influencing professional satisfaction.

## Tools Used
* Microsoft Forms – for survey creation and data collection
* Power Query and DAX – for data cleaning and preparation
* Power BI – for interactive visualization and storytelling

## Insights:

**1. Respondent Profile**
- Majority of respondents fall within the 25–50 age group, with male respondents making up the majority, though female participation remains significant.
- Most respondents hold either a bachelor’s or master’s degree. The largest share are employed as Data Analysts, followed by those identifying as “Other” and "students or unemployed".
- A noticeable percentage of respondents are career switchers, highlighting the accessibility of the data field to professionals from diverse backgrounds.

**2. Entry into Data Careers**
- Respondents report multiple entry paths: formal education, online courses, and self-learning are the most cited.
- Career switching is a significant trend — many professionals entered data after starting in other industries.
- Most career switchers find the transition “moderately challenging” to “difficult,” emphasizing the value of clearer pathways and structured onboarding into data roles.

**3. Job Satisfaction & Career Aspirations**
- Top Satisfaction Drivers: Work-life balance, management support, and opportunities for learning new things rank highest.
- Salary Satisfaction averages around 4.3/10, signaling compensation is a critical area for improvement.
- Younger professionals (18–24) show lower satisfaction compared to experienced peers, suggesting expectations vs. reality gaps early in careers.
- Respondent's top considerations for new jobs are:
  1. Better Salary
  2. Remote Work
  3. Work-life Balance

## Key takeaways
- The data field attracts both early-career professionals and career switchers, showing its broad appeal.
- Satisfaction depends heavily on non-monetary factors (work-life balance, learning opportunities), not just salary.
- Retention risks are highest among younger professionals, who report the lowest happiness scores.

## Recommendations
- Enhance Career Development Programs: Offer mentorship, defined growth paths, and opportunities for skill advancement.
- Address Salary Expectations: Benchmark compensation competitively to reduce dissatisfaction.
- Promote Flexibility & Balance: Continue remote and hybrid work models while investing in employee well-being.
- Support Career Switchers: Build structured onboarding and training to help them adapt faster.
- Focus on Retention of Early-Career Talent: Provide transparent progression paths and realistic expectation setting.
